"""Collect finished evaluation results from GitHub and regenerate leaderboards.

This script is meant to run on the maintainer's laptop. For each open
``model evaluation request`` issue that has been assigned (meaning it has
been picked up by the compute server) and has at least one comment with a
``jsonl`` code fence, it:

1. Extracts the first ``jsonl`` fenced block from the issue comments.
2. Concatenates all those blocks into ``new_results.jsonl`` at the repo
   root, overwriting any previous file.
3. Runs ``python -m scripts.generate_leaderboards`` to merge the new
   results into the leaderboards.
4. Builds the frontend and deploys it to Vercel as a prebuilt artifact
   (so Vercel's CLI never has to upload the >100 MB ``.git`` packfile).
5. Closes the corresponding GitHub issues -- which removes them from the
   queue in the frontend.

Required env vars
-----------------
GITHUB_TOKEN        A PAT with ``issues: write`` for the EuroEval repo.
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY A Hugging Face token with write access to upload results.
